# Vehicle Collisions [14+ callouts]

**IMPORTANT NOTE** For the record, I am a PHP developer (in particular with the Laravel framework), I am not a professional C# developer, what's shown inside this repository is me learning C#. Bear with me as I go with this and learning, positive critisism is welcome. That being said, I am a firefighter in real life with enough scenario's in my head to process for FivePD, which I am trying to illustrate here.

## List of callouts

* Bike crashed into car (27 different locations)
* Traffic light malfunction with crash
* Severe crash with military convoy
* Traffic fight with crash
* Military transport problems (10 different locations, 4 different outcomes)
* Traffic check assistance
* Car crashed into church
* Car crashed into sewers
* Car drove through roadblock (13 different locations)
* Big accident on bridge (Unlimited different locations stretched over a long road)
* Crash with emergency services
* Highway accidents (15 different locations)
* Car crash with fire (4 different locations)
* Car patrol tank leak (15 different locations)

Each callout also brings its own dynamics, which I am of course still working on. The Military transport problems has the most dynamics at this moment.

## Installation

Place the VehicleCollisions.net.dll inside your /callouts folder from FivePD.

## Version

This callout has been built with the latest API (1.1) so it will only support 1.1 or higher versions.
